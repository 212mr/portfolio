PORTFOLIO

User Interface / UI

Clean and flat UI design makes your app, software or website look modern and desirable. I ensure your branding and user experience is tucked up in a neat little UI package.

User Experience / UX

Smart user experiences are not only simple to pick up but also functional to use. I make sure every step is planned and avoids wasted actions.

Branding

I create beautiful brands that are both modern and functional, I design stylish colour palettes, use stunning fonts and ensure your brand looks its best.

    After receiving my bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Chicago, I spent a few years on Wall Street in sales and trading. Life was good, but something was missing. I wanted to create something meaningful that would impact the world.
    I jumped at the opportunity to work at an e-commerce startup in Chicago. There, I saw firsthand how design can make a business successful by solving real user needs. Serious about pursuing a career in design, I studied Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University and built a solid design foundation. Life has been nothing short of an endless learning experience with unlimited possibilities.
